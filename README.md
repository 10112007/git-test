# Welcome to My Git Testing Repo

This is just a testing repository for my Github account

- This is an example of C code:

```c
    int main() {
        printf("Hello World!\n");
        return 0;
    }
```

- This is an example of JavaScript code:

```javascript
    console.log("Hello World!");
```
